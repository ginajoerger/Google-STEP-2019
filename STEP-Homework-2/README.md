# STEP-Homework-2
Algorithms and Data Structure

Instructions:

1. Write code to calculate C = A * B, where A, B and C are matrices of size N * N
2. Measure the execution time of your code for various Ns, and plot the relationship between N and the execution time

File Explanation:

1. "N_Time.py" is code calculating C = A * B, where A, B and C are matrices of size N * N.
2. "N and Execution Time.png" shows the speed of the code above.
